# BizReach - cd-user-baddies

### Iteration 01

 * Start date: June 12th, 2023
 * End date: June 16th, 2023


### Roles & responsibilities

All members have agreed to doing both backend and frontend tasks. Aneeq is responsible for Jira. All members are responsible for Firebase, Github, Figma.


### Events

We plan to have meetings every day online via discord. We may skip some stand ups if there isnt much to discuss. Each stand up will be transcribed and summarized and posted on slack.

The purpose of each meeting is to discuss everyones progress on their respective tasks.

Coding sessions, code reviews and other events are spontaneous. These meetings are scheduled during the daily stand up.

### Artifacts

We utilized jira as our product management tool to organize and track progress. Jira lets us create a backlog of tasks that need to be completed. During our stand ups, we collaboratively determine what tasks should be priortized within the current sprint. After weâ€™ve defined the tasks for the sprint, each team member has the opportunity to select the tasks they will work on.

### Goals and tasks

For this iteration, our goal is to implement the sign up and log in feature for BizReach. Since our platform has two types of users, we want to ensure the sign up feature works for both service providers (businesses) and service seekers(customers).

The tasks we need to complete to meet our goals:

- As an unregistered user, I want to be able to easily register so I can access the list of services available to me.
- As a user, I want to be able to log out of my account, so I can use another account if I need to
- As a business owner, I want to register as a business account, so I can sell my services to those who require them


### Artifacts

To produce our project idea, we are building a static website, pushing it to our github repo so we can utilize our platform anytime and anywhere. We also have developed low fidelity prototypes of our project idea so, our frontend designers are on the same page.
