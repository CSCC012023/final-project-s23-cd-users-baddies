Introduction: We started off with explaning the main features we worked on. Each member of the team explained the part they worked on, shared their screen and ran and quick demo of the features they implemented for the sprint.

Decisions that turned out well: We refactored our code in way where we made easier for each member to connect the feature they worked on all together. In addition, we redesigned our schema and structured out perfectly to fetch data easier as well as be able to access it smoothly. This was a very important step to be taken in order for data flow to be smooth and accessible lighter.

Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped: Not focussing on UI has kind of given us a hard time view our backend implementation and visualize it. UI is a crucial part of the project, it helps make things much more organized and appearable as well give a more accurate representation of the implementation of the backend. Also working on the UI half way through has kind of made things bug a little which gave a hard time debugging and fixing but all went well eventually. 

Â Planned changes:
1- Finish implementing our messaging system using sockets.
2-Focus on the UI and give it more time to make our work appearable.
3- Make our Gigs show posts information 
4- Allow data in posts and gigs pages to be editable and deletable for more felxability

Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
1- Implemented Gigs and posts pages - https://bizreach2023.atlassian.net/browse/BIZ-3, https://bizreach2023.atlassian.net/browse/BIZ-61 
2- Allow user to receive messages from businesses - https://bizreach2023.atlassian.net/browse/BIZ-49
3- Improved UI of the log in and sign up pages - https://bizreach2023.atlassian.net/browse/BIZ-53
4- Created a notifications tab for both business and customer - https://bizreach2023.atlassian.net/browse/BIZ-55
5- implemented notification functionality - https://bizreach2023.atlassian.net/browse/BIZ-56
6- created flow between notification and messages - https://bizreach2023.atlassian.net/browse/BIZ-54

Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:: 
1- Improve UI of every page - not fully finished because having the UI being implemented later has given a hard time but will done perfectly at the end
2- Allow data to be editable by user or business - not done because we needed to finalize the schema for each page perfectly

Meeting Highlights: 
1- UI as a Priority: Acknowledge the importance of UI and make it a priority from the beginning of the development process. By focusing on UI early on, it becomes easier to visualize the backend implementation and identify potential issues, reducing the challenges faced during debugging and fixing.
2- Improved Data Accessibility and Flexibility: Continue to refine the schema and data structure to ensure smoother data flow and easier access. Allow data in posts and gigs pages to be editable and deletable to provide more flexibility and control to users and businesses.
3- Messaging System and Notifications: Complete the implementation of the messaging system using sockets, allowing users to communicate seamlessly. Ensure a smooth flow between notifications and messages, enhancing the user experience.
4- Iterative Refactoring: Emphasize iterative refactoring of code to make it more maintainable and scalable. The previous decision to refactor the code and connect features together proved beneficial; continue this practice to maintain a clean and cohesive codebase
5- Documentation and Collaboration: Encourage team members to maintain clear documentation of their work and encourage collaboration during sprint reviews. This helps in knowledge sharing and enables a better understanding of different parts of the project.
